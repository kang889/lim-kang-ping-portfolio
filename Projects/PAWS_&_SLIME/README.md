Overview

A 2D action-adventure game built using C++ and Raylib, where the player controls a dog battling slimes in an open-world environment. The game features enemy AI, dynamic movement, and combat mechanics.

Features

Open-World Exploration – Seamlessly move across a continuous environment.

Dynamic Enemy AI – Slimes use vector normalization to chase the player.

Combat System – Attack enemies with collision-based combat mechanics.

Smooth Animations – Frame-based animations for fluid character movement.

Resource Management – Efficient handling of textures, sounds, and game states.

Optimized Performance – Uses object-oriented programming (OOP) and range-based for loops for efficiency.

Technologies & Concepts

C++ & Raylib – Core game development tools.

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Structured and modular game design.

Vector Normalization – Enables smooth enemy movement towards the player.

Collision Detection – Detects interactions between player and enemies.

Range-Based For Loops – Enhances performance by simplifying iteration.

Texture & Resource Management – Efficient loading and handling of assets.
