# lim kang ping portfolio
My name is lim kang ping and I am a new tech enthusiast who recently discovered his interest and passion in creating coding projects.
i was initially a Business/ human resource student. However, during my internship i had the opportunity to use the organistion's human resource information system (HRIS), which exposed me to the use of data science tools. This exposure led me to realise how much capability in efficiency this data tools are able to bring to us, resulting improved decision-making and streamlined processes. This realization ignited my interest in technology, particularly in data science and coding.

here are the projects that i have build in the process of learning python:
