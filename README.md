# lim kang ping portfolio
My name is Lim Kang Ping and I am a new tech enthusiast who recently discovered his interest and passion in creating coding projects.
I was initially a Business/ human resource student. However, during my internship, i had the opportunity to use the organization's human resource information system (HRIS), which exposed me to the use of data science tools. This exposure led me to realize how much capability in efficiency these data tools can bring to us. This realization ignited my interest in technology, particularly in data science and coding.

Here are the projects that I have build in the process of learning Python:

.Digital clock
- Creating a digital clock was a practical application of my Python knowledge, reinforcing my understanding of time-related concepts and allowing experimentation with tkinter for graphical user interface programming. The simplicity of the project served as an excellent starting point, boosting my confidence and providing a solid foundation in Python development.

.Password generator
- This project was created as I wanted a faster solution to creating new passwords. It allowed me to apply programming skills to a practical context, reinforcing my understanding of algorithms and contributing to a safer digital environment.

.Password strength checker
- This project was created for me to easily check to ensure that the passowrd used are up to standard. It allowed me to apply programming skills to a practical context, reinforcing my understanding of algorithms and contributing to a safer digital environment.
